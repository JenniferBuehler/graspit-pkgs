/**
 * \brief Provides a scene manager which can be used to load and access the GraspIt! world.
 *
 * This class manages access to the graspit world object and operations which can be performed on it.
 * It also runs an event loop, which may be implemented in various ways in subclasses. In some
 * implementations, this thread may have a special meaning, e.g. when it is also the thread which runs
 * a SoQt main loop. This thread may be required to do operations use elsewhere.
 * Instances of class GraspItAccessor may get access to the thread which runs this event loop
 * via GraspItAccessor::addAsIdleListener().
 *
 * There should only be once instance of GraspItSceneManager for each GraspIt! world. Access to this world and
 * running of other GraspIt algorithms should be handled by GraspItAccessor instances.
 * There can be several GraspItAccessor objects operating on the same graspit world.
 *
 * GraspItSceneManager and GraspItAccessor work closely together as friends, therefore some of the protected
 * methods in this class have also been made available for GraspItAccessor subclasses.
 *
 * GraspItSceneManager can be extended in various ways by subclasses which access individual parts of
 * the original GraspIt! code.
 * However it is recommended to have a look at the class GraspItAccessor to see if access to the GraspIt!
 * world is enough for the implementation. To keep things modular, this class should only be re-implemented in
 * subclasses if access via GraspItAccessor is not sufficient.
 * GraspItSceneManager basically only should handle the main scene manager loop and manage the world,
 * similar to how IVmgr in the original GraspIt! source does.
 *
 * Before a GraspItSceneManager instance can be used, it has to be initialized by calling initialize().
 * It is expected that subclasses constructors call this method, but there is no harm in calling it several times.
 * Methods waitUntilReady() and isReady() can be used to check whether the object has finished initializing, but
 * usually this should have been made sure by initialize(), so it should not be required.
 * Similarly, before destruction, the method shutdown() has to be called. It is expected that subclasses call it
 * from their destructors, but there's no harm in calling it several times.
 *
 * Worlds, robots and objects/obstacles can only be loaded from files. This is because from within the XML files, other
 * XML files are referenced (e.g. contact files, robot/object files, etc.). Moreover, the current graspit source is laid
 * out for loading from files (or specific database access only). The current source only allows bodies (objects/obstacles)
 * to be specified as XML within a world file (without referencing another file).
 * Loading robots and contact files still requires actual files to be present. Threrefore, at the current stage, rather
 * than providing *load-from-xmlstring* methods, it is easier to create a temporary folder with all XML files and then
 * call the load* methods of this class with the filenames.
 * This can be done in an external helper class if required.

     * World destructor before the World is completely destroyed.

     * all children of it (this happens right AFTER the World destructor

     * However, the Body and Robot destructors still access the

     * care of deleting all these objects BEFORE the World object
     * is destroyed.
