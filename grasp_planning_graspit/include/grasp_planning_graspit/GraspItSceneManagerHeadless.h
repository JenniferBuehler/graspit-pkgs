/**
 * \brief Provides scene manager which can be used to load and access the GraspIt! world without the need to run the GUI.
 *
 * In this initial implementation, this interface will be running the **SoQt** loop in a separate thread.
 * This is also the scene manager thread to which GraspItAccessor instances may get access to via GraspItAccessor::addAsIdleListener().
 *
 * Subclasses which want to make use of QT signals and slots, or any other mechanisms proivded by QObject and
 * the Qt metaobject system, will have to additionally derive from QObject, and the MOC files have to be generated for it.
 *
 * **Important note:** While this implementation is still using Qt, you **may not** touch any Qt stuff before creating an intance
 * of this class. This means, you cannot create any QObject instances either. Otherwise you will get the Qt warning
 * "WARNING: QApplication was not created in the main() thread". Mostly this should not matter, but it could cause
 * problems, e.g. with QPixmap, if you are using them.
