/**
 * \brief Runs the GraspIt! Eigengrasp planning algorithm.
 *
 * This class extends the GraspItAccessor class to run the Eigengrasp planning algorithms
 * in the original graspit source on the world.
 *
 * In the current implementation, Qt is required for running the Eigengrasp planner.
 * GraspItSceneManager::eventThreadRunsQt() needs to return true for the GraspItSceneManager
 * passed into the constructor of this class. For an example on how to implement this class
 * without direct Qt dependencies, check out EigenGraspPlannerNoQt.
 *
 * *Notes*: See also [git issue #1](https://github.com/JenniferBuehler/graspit-pkgs/issues/1) for restrictions of this class.
 *
 * *Important note for developers*: This class should not be derived further in its current implementation.
 * This is because it uses an SoIdleSensor locally which it destroys in the destructor. This needs to be destroyed *before*
 * the mandatory call of removeFromIdleListeners() in all subclasses destructors.
 * Support for further extension is easy to achieve (by not using the local SoIdleSensor or adding a new method
 * shutdownEigenGraspPlanner() or similar), but it has not been considered at this stage yet.
